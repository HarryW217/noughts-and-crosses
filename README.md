# Noughts and Crosses


## Project Summary

"Noughts and Crosses" is the classic game (otherwise known at "Tic-Tac-Toe") created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is designed for two players two play the game on one monitor, taking their turns to mark the 3x3 grid with an "X" or an "O". The game checks for winners, draws, and keeps score of how many wins each player has!

## What I learned

`Visual Appeal`: Following a tutorial and using my own creative license, I gained experience in using CSS to choose dynamic colors and lay out HTML elements, creating a visually striking app. 

`Implementation of Sound`: For the first time, I was able to incorporate audio feedback for user interactions. The use of a clicking sound on every click of the board and the dramatic music when a game ends adds more flair to the user experience. 

`Game Logic with JavaScript`: It always engaging to have practise in using JS functions to handle events and conditions in a web app. I could use a tutorial to handle player turns and checking for a winner. Beyond that, I created functionality to update the player scoreboard depending on who won a particular game. 

## Instructions

So, wanna have hours of fun playing Noughts and Crosses? Or maybe you have your own funky ideas for additional features?

Open your terminal and navigate to the directory you would like to keep this project in. Once you're there, enter the following command:

```
git clone (then paste the repo url here)
```

I would recommend opening the repo on VS Code and installing 'Live Server' to locally host the website and see it as you edit it.
